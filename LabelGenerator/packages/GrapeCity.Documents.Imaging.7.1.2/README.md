Document Solutions for Imaging (DsImaging, formerly GcImaging) is a fast,
powerful imaging API library. It allows developers to do advanced image
processing in C# or VB.NET code with no 3rd party dependencies. DsImaging is

- Read and write multi-frame GIF, ICO, and TIFF formats with access to individual frames.
- Load Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG, SVGZ) images into the provided SVG document object model.
- Create from scratch or modify existing SVG images using the SVG DOM.
- Use the same full set of common graphics drawing tools with raster and vector images.
- Rasterize vector images to combine with other graphics.
- Advanced text rendering capabilities, powerful character and paragraph formatting.
- Support for RTL text (including Kashida in Arabic) and bitmap glyphs in OpenType CJK fonts.
- Table layout engine for creating complex grid-based layouts with text and graphics.
- Perform rotate, flip, crop, resize, composite, blend operations.
